            The game was created with the <b style="color: var(--clr-fg-alt);">Unity Engine</b> and released on the Play
            Store. The game's mechanics are straightforward; the player must avoid enemy bombs and spikes while
            collecting points like gold, gems, and other valuable items. I primarily worked on the UI Design, sprites,
            and animations for it. The first game created in Unity and released on the Playstore was this one.
            I gained a better understanding of UI and asset creation thanks to this game. and discovered creator side
            view and analytics.<br>

            <li>Starting with this game and uploading it to the play store was done completely without any prior game
              development knowledge.</li>
            <li>As a <b style="color: var(--clr-fg-alt);">UI and game designer</b>, I gained a lot of experience and
              knowledge about tools that are utilised in Unity. </li>
            <li>While developing this game, I learnt how to use prefabs effectively and learned about different sprites,
              sprite sheets, the UI canvas, scene management, build settings, and player preferences. In-game Unity

            It aided in my learning more about team leadership and finishing a game within a set amount of time.
            <li>Supervised a group of six people who worked on a duality-based game for the Chennai Global Game Jam.
            </li>
            <li>Successfully created the game in the allotted 48 hours and uploaded it on their website.</li>
            <li>The amount of duties I had as the team leader was excessive, yet our group was strong enough to solve
              many issues.
              We all closely collaborated on this game, faced numerous challenges, and found solutions.</li>
            <li>With our dedication and enthusiasm for game development, we were recognised as winners at the Chennai

            The first AR project was completed utilising the Unity Engine and its AR, XR, and <b

            camera on gadgets like mobile phones and webcams. This game is designed for Android smartphones. To play,
            simply position the camera on the device and press the start button. Balloons will then keep dropping from
            the top,
            and you'll need to shoot them using the UI shot button on the bottom right.
            <li>Vuforia SDKs were mostly used with Image targets, and work was done with single-level, multiple-level,
              and other ITs.</li>
            <li>In Unity, I worked on AR buttons, and I utilised this to make a piano project.</li>
            <li>Vuforia was used in numerous projects, including the solar system project, the piano, single image
