            The game's mechanics are straightforward; the player must avoid enemy bombs and spikes while collecting
            points
            like gold, gems, and other valuable items. I primarily worked on the UI Design, sprites, and animations for
            it.
            The first game created in Unity and released on the PlayStore was this one. I gained a better understanding
            of
            UI and asset creation thanks to this game.

              knowledge about tools that are utilised in Unity.</li>
            <li>While developing this game, I learnt how to use prefabs effectively and learned about different sprites,
              sprite sheets, the UI canvas, scene management, build settings, and player preferences. In-game Unity
